## User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Description

For Challenge 1 of Module 1 we were instructed to improve the accessibility of an existing website. In order to do that we had to refactor the code of the website for the company called Horiseon.

By refactoring the code we not only made the website more accessible for its users, but also cleaned it up for future edits by future software developers. Additionally, the refactored code improved SEO for the company.

By learning to parse apart the information that is important for an application/website, we can more effectively write lines of code that are easier to read and collaborate upon. It is important to remove redundant information and consolidate information where necessary and to act as a "scout" would - leaving the code better than we found it.
